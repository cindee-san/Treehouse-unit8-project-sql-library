# Treehouse-unit8-project-sql-library
 
## In this project, I built a web application that includes pages to list, add, update, and delete books, given HTML designs and an existing SQLite database. I implemented a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, SQLite and the SQL ORM Sequelize.
